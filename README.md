Restaraunt App

Built With:
Node version 8.10.0
React version 16.8.6
Express version 4.17.1

Mock website made for a restaraunt. Made this to improve skills in making websites using react and also to gain some understanding of node/express. Learned how to do useful things such as tabbed menus and image carousels which can be applied later to other websites I would make in the future.
